How we connected our form with SQL Database :-

1. We recieved the data from POST from FORM and stored them in differenet variables.
$name = $_POST['name'];
$email = $_POST['email'];
$contactNumber = $_POST['contactNumber'];
$subject = $_POST['subject'];
$message = $_POST['message'];

2. Create connection with SQL Database by instantiating.
$conn = new mysqli('localhost','root','','data');
URL=localhost
username=root
password=''
database name=data

3. Made a SQL statement and stored that in a variable.
        $stmt = $conn->prepare("insert into registration(name, email, contactNumber, subject , message) values(?, ?, ?, ?, ?)");
table name = registration 

4. Placed variables in the statement.
$stmt->bind_param("sssss",$name, $email, $contactNumber, $subject, $message);

5. Executed the update query on Database.
$stmt->execute();
